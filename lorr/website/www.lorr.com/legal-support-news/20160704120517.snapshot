		<p>Though outsourcing to a Texas record retrieval firm is certainly optional, the truth is that it’s the absolute best way to position your firm for long-term success, especially in a highly competitive marketplace. If you’re looking for a way to give your team and clients an edge over the competition, using a professional record retrieval service is definitely the way to go.</p>

		<p>There are dozens of reasons a firm may outsource their subpoena services: maybe they are overwhelmed with work, maybe they are short staffed, or maybe they just want to ensure the task is handled by a true professional. Whatever the reason, outsourcing subpoena services can provide hefty benefits to a legal team.</p>

		<p>Many law firms handle record retrieval in house. Unfortunately, just because it’s commonplace doesn’t mean it’s the best choice for your firm. In fact, many in-house records operations are actually less efficient and more costly than outsourced options — and that can be a big detriment to firms in the long run.</p>

		<p>It’s certainly possible to handle your own record retrieval, but the real question is: Do you really want to? Record retrieval is tedious, time-consuming, and boring. And it’s also extremely important. It’s not a task you can pass off to an intern, and it’s not something you can let fall by the wayside, since your case probably depends on it!</p>

		<p>As a lawyer, you have many costs to consider. You have costs of licensing and malpractice insurance, you have to cover salaries and benefits for all your employees, and you have all the little expenses that go along with each and every case you handle. It can add up quick, and the thought of adding on more costs — like having someone help with record retrieval, subpoena service, or other tasks you just don’t have time for — is more than overwhelming.</p>

		<p>When you’re handling a car accident, workplace injury, or malpractice case, medical records are pretty important to your final outcome. With the right records, you can prove your client was injured, their life irreparably changed, and the defendant obviously and undeniably guilty. Without them, you could find yourself in an uphill battle, with very little chance of clinching that win for your client.</p>

For one, it takes you (or a team member) away from other, more pressing matters. Just think: What if the witness is hard to track down? Do you really want your paralegal spending a full week trying to locate and serve them? That&#8217;s doubtful.</p>
