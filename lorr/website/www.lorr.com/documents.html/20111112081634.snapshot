<h1>LORR's Online Repository</h1>

<p>Imagine having your entire case - pleadings, discovery, statements, depositions, records, exhibits, research, videos, and photographs - with you anywhere you go, but without dragging heavy document boxes or bulky case notebooks. LORR can make that happen with our Online Repository.</p>

<p>LORR will scan your documents, convert photographs and videotapes to digital formats, and create a digital library of your files, then store them in a secure, password-protected database that is available to you via the Internet 24/7.</p>

<p><a href="http://lorr.egnyte.com"><img src="login.jpg" width="526" height="105" border="0" alt="Login to LORR's Online Repository"></a></p>

<p>No more copy and delivery costs for sending documents to experts or clients – digital versions of your materials can be e-mailed. No more copying documents for production – responsive exhibits can be produced on CD to opposing counsel. And you greatly reduce the amount of paper filling up your closets – good for your office and good for the environment.</p>

<p>By using LORR's Online Repository, if you have an Internet connection, you can access your files. LORR provides an affordable, web-based document management system that stores your documents, photographs, records, deposition transcripts, notes, e-mails, and videos and provides secure access to that material. LORR will create your account, set up your username and password, and train you in the system's use.</p>

<p>LORR's Online Repository is also an excellent archiving solution, eliminating those mountains of file boxes collecting dust in a closet or off-site storage and putting them online, where you can quickly search for specific documents. LORR can create archives of any materials you chose - closed cases, experts, important depositions, or legal research.</p>

<h2>The Courts Go Digital</h2>

<p>The legal profession may never be completely paperless, but the trend is clearly growing.</p>

<p>U.S. District Courts, including all four in Texas, accept only e-filing, and Texas state and county courts are beginning to follow suit. A handful have gone to mandatory online filing using private firms to handle the process. However, as opposed to the free Federal e-filing system, these companies charge for each document filed.</p>

<p>Whether e-filing is free or not, law firms need to be able to e-file, and that means being able to convert documents to PDF (Adobe's Portable Document Format.) The new version of Microsoft Word can convert to PDF, and there are free programs available online, such as CutePDF Writer, which convert documents to PDF.</p>
