<h1>Serving Your Subpoena or Citation</h1>

<img src="server1.jpg" width="255" height="149" border="0" class="floatLeft">
<p>LORR's service personnel are certified according to Rule 103 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and will serve citations on parties and subpoenas on witnesses or parties for deposition or trial.</p>

<p>We understand the sensitivities of service, and can be aggressive with difficult witnesses and discreet with cooperative witnesses.</p>

<p>LORR can also assist in issuing subpoenas and in picking up citations from the courthouse.</p>

<p>Once service is executed, our service personnel endorse the citation or subpoena and return it to the court. While we pride ourselves in being able to effect service, we realize that on rare occasions service is not possible. In that case, we document the diligence used to attempt service, the reason for the inability to serve, and then return the citation or subpoena to the court, per the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>

<h2>Rule 103. Who May Serve</h2>

<p>Process - including citation and other notices, writs, orders, and other papers issued by the court -
may be served anywhere by (1) any sheriff or constable or other person authorized by law, (2) any person authorized by law or by written order of the court who is not less than eighteen years of age, or (3) any person certified under order of the Supreme Court. Service by registered or certified mail and citation by publication must, if requested, be made by the clerk of the court in which the case is pending. But no person who is a party to or interested in the outcome of a suit may serve any process in that suit, and, unless otherwise authorized by a written court order, only a sheriff or constable may serve a citation in an action of forcible entry and detainer, a writ that requires the actual taking possession of a person, property, or thing, or process requiring that an enforcement action be physically enforced by the person delivering the process. The order authorizing a person to serve process may be made without written motion and no fee may be imposed for issuance of such order.</p>
